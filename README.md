# uwoifier
---
Simple script that takes the input (either from a file or in a interactive repl) and returns back string with randomly changed words but in a way that still makes sense in terms of 'UwU' or 'OwO' :)

Usage is very easy, just download the repo and run with: ```python ./uwoifier.py```. Everything will explain by itself.
